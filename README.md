# hack-a-thing-1-pong

*Built with Unity 2D, using the tutorial at https://www.awesomeincu.com/tutorials/unity-pong/*

## Description
Pong is a 2D standalone game that allows 4 players to play ping pong using keyboard controls. The program picks a random direction for the ping pong ball at the start of each round. 

## Who did What
- Nicole

  - Added music
  - Built MacOS executable
- Kevin
  - Found the tutorial
  - Added walls

## What we learned
- How to create Game Objects in Unity2D including players and other objects
- How to create play scenes through C# scripts
- How to build a standalone executable game

## What didn't work
- Using Unity with Git was not a smooth experience. At first there were many merge conflicts because Unity automatically generates files when the game is run. This was resolved by adding those files in .gitignore.
